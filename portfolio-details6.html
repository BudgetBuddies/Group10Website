<p>During Quarters 1 and 2, the team focused on finalizing the live streaming content and streaming tools. Now that we are in Quarter 3, the team will be focusing on producing and conducting the actual live stream. Of course, one cannot proceed with the actual live stream without proper preparation to ensure that the stream will run smoothly and according to plan. With this being said, listed below are the things the team prepared in order to deliver a high-quality stream.
</p>

<p><b>Logo Redesign</b></p> 
<p>Due to the simplicity and unprofessional appearance of the Budget Buddies logo during the 1st and 2nd quarters, the Group Facilitator decided to redesign the Budget Buddies Logo. This image will be used in all Quarter 3 graphic material to represent the brand. Shown below are new green and black versions of the Budget Buddies logo.
</p>

<p><b>LiveStream Research</b></p> 
<p>When going live, streamers should prepare all the content that will be streamed. Our team conducted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZcY6ff0AvaT-Uo60kERPJCmIZi8pQKF0-PJQACcFTJU/edit?usp=sharing"><b>research</b></a> on the topics and aspects of financial literacy that will be discussed during the live stream. The gathered data and research was arranged and turned into this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BeEnRsZl2qthIY9BoLqxKk5UJhTfrRP25olTqdLiZ_g/edit?usp=sharing"><b>script</b></a>, which will be followed by the hosts to ensure the smoothness of the stream and prevent dead air. This will also help us further familiarize ourselves with our content. This will help us answer our viewers’ questions or concerns throughout the stream and in the Open Question and Answer segment. After writing the script, the Group Facilitator created the slideshow that will be presented during the stream to provide viewers with a visual presentation of the topics for their better understanding.

<p><b>DMCA Checklist</b></p> 
<p>The team ought for the stream to be visually attractive and creative for the enjoyment of the viewers. The team chose background music and images that are appropriate for the content, and at the same time, appealing to both the eyes and the ears. But we would also like to do this without violating the DMCA, or Digital Millennium Copyright Act. So, the team looked for alternatives in non-copyrighted media sources and created a checklist, which can be seen below, to make ensure that the stream would not receive any DMCA violations. In line with this, we updated and finalized our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r3EcBcd9SbuRWR2rEHrR57IV18_OXxvXIF-meushwRI/edit?usp=sharing"><b>stream outline</b></a>, such as when each piece of background music will be played and the specific topics that were researched in LiveStream Research.</p>

                            <p><b>Streamlabs Testing</b></p>   
                            <p>In Quarter 2, we decided to use OBS as our streaming software. However, due to unforeseen technical problems and the larger library of elements that could be accessed, we switched to Streamlabs as our streaming software. To avoid more technical problems related to this, we vigorously tested all aspects before the stream. We inserted or linked our stream layout and tested the alerts, cameras, and background music. Below is a screenshot and a video recording of the Budget Buddies Streamlabs setup.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Dry Run</b></p>
                            <p>Aside from preparing and testing the stream materials, the streamers also conducted a dry run practice to replicate the live stream that will soon take place. Our team decided to have a recording of us testing all the materials while acting as though we were already live streaming. This helped us familiarize ourselves with our outline and how we will be doing these in the actual stream. By practicing numerous times, the team was able to create backup plans for possible technical problems, and finalize everything before the stream.

                            <p><b>Promotional Materials</b></p>   
<p> To achieve high viewership, the team created additional promotional materials to inform and promote our upcoming live stream. We created a new and improved poster and promotional video which contain our streaming date, time, and content that helps add depth and excitement to our overall brand promotion. We made sure that these new promotional materials were enhanced by adding eye-catching designs and elements. Each design was also made consistent by sticking to our color palette, which helps communicate the message and goal that our brand and stream has. The streamers also individually shared these materials for a greater chance to reach more people.
