                            <p class="item-intro text-muted" style="color:white">Preparing and testing our stream materials</p>
                            <hr style="color:white;">
<p>During the past two quarters, we focused on finalizing our live streaming content and tools. Now that we are in quarter 3, we will be focusing on doing the actual live stream. Of course, one cannot proceed with the actual live stream without enough preparation to ensure that everything will go smoothly and according to plan. With this being said, below are the things we prepared in order to achieve a high-quality stream:</p>

<p><b>1. LiveStream Research</b></p> 
<p>When going live, streamers should prepare all the content to be streamed. As for our team, we conducted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZcY6ff0AvaT-Uo60kERPJCmIZi8pQKF0-PJQACcFTJU/edit?usp=sharing"><b>research</b></a> on the topics that will be discussed during the live stream and turned this into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BeEnRsZl2qthIY9BoLqxKk5UJhTfrRP25olTqdLiZ_g/edit?usp=sharing"><b>script</b></a>, since having a script will help us have a smoother transition between the topics and avoid dead air or mental blocks. This will also help us familiarize our content, which can help us answer our viewers questions or concerns. After writing the script, we created the slideshow that will be presented during the stream so that the viewers have a visual presentation of what we are talking about and can better understand it.</p>

<p><b>2. DMCA Checklist</b></p> 
<p>We want our stream to be as attractive and creative as possible for our viewers. We want background music and images that are appropriate to our content and, at the same time, are creative and attractive. But we also like to do this without violating the DMCA, or Digital Millennium Copyright Act. So, we looked for alternatives in non-copyrighted sources like Snapmuse and made a checklist, which can be seen below, to make sure that we would not have any DMCA violations. In line with this, we updated and finalized our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r3EcBcd9SbuRWR2rEHrR57IV18_OXxvXIF-meushwRI/edit?usp=sharing"><b>stream outline</b></a>, such as when each piece of background music will be played and the specific topics that were researched in Number 1: LiveStream Research.</p>

                            <p><b>3. Streamlabs Testing</b></p>   
                            <p>Last quarter, we decided to use OBS as our streaming software. But due to unforeseen technical problems, we had to switch to Streamlabs, as this was our second option. To avoid more technical problems related to this, we tested it out. We inserted or linked our stream layout and tested the alerts, cameras, and background music. Below is a screenshot and recording of it:</p>

                            <p><b>4. Dry Run</b></p>
                            <p>Aside from preparing and testing the stream materials, the streamers should also have a quick practice on how they would do the actual live stream. So, our team decided to have a recording of us testing all the materials while acting as though we were already live streaming. This helped us familiarize ourselves with our outline, like how we will be doing it in the actual stream, create backup plans for possible technical problems, and finalize everything.</p>

                            <p><b>5. Promotional Materials</b></p>   
<p> To achieve high viewership, we had to create additional promotional materials to inform our viewers about our upcoming live. We created a new and improved poster and promotional video that contains our streaming date, time, and content that helps add depth and excitement to our overall brand promotion. We made sure that these new promotional materials were improved by adding eye-catching designs and elements. Each design was also improved by sticking to our color palette, which helps communicate the message and goal that our brand has. The streamers also individually shared these materials for a greater chance to reach more people.
