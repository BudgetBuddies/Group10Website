    <p style="font-size:17px">This is one of the most important parts if you want to become a streamer; you need to identify your viewers needs in your content type and content or topic itself. As for our group, we used 2 different techniques from "design thinking: emphatize stage" to identify their needs. By using the first method, 5 whys, we identified the root cause of lack of financial literacy to students; which is the lack of teachers and experts who are able to teach financial literacy. Additionally, our team conducted a survey (also used in getting the demographics of viewers part) and 76 people preferred watching educational videos, compared to on-demand podcasts and educational live streams, on the topic of Financial Literacy. Within this survey, we applied the Design Thinking Process through empathizing with our participants by asking them what qualities they look for in a successful educational video; or the aspects needed to make an educational video strong and truly informative (Conducting Interviews with Empathy).</p>
    <p style="font-size:17px">With this, our team identified that the viewers needs to see quality information, interesting topics, clear voice-overs, simple translations of the topic, and the video appearance of the speaker. The other aspects will also be present, but not as prioritized due to the number of participants who decided to include them in their choice. In addition to this are:</p>      <ul>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs useful, valuable, and relevant information.</li>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs simple explanations or translations of the topic.</li>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs captivating material.</li>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs clear and understandable voiceovers.</li>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs to know the importance of Financial Literacy.</li>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs to understand various financial terms.</li>
<li style="font-size:17px">The audience needs to know how to save, budget, and manage their money effectively.</li>
