                              <p>Our group was tasked to conduct a research study; specifically a case study about the specific interests or topics we would like to focus on. As for our team, we ultimately decided on "The Case Study on The Numerous Effects of Learning Financial Literacy Among the High School Students of APEC Schools Ortigas Extension Conducted in the Year 2022-2023". This is where our methodology or procedure on how we plan to study and research this topic comes in.
                              </p>
                              <p>Due to the fact that it imparts knowledge on fundamental financial topics like budgeting, investing, and income generation, financial literacy is a key skill for both adults and kids to develop in the real world. As a result, we intend to use a mixed method approach, or mixed qualitative and quantitative research, to analyze the data from this study in order to address the effects of learning financial literacy among APEC students through conducting a survey to APEC students. We will use a mixed method approach because the data we will gather will include both numbers and financial statistics in addition to quality, effects, and literacy.</p>
                            <p>With this being said, We, researchers, conducted a survey among APEC students in any grade level and section as financial literacy can be open for everyone but will be focusing on highschool students' responses as they are the main subject of our study. After receiving approval for our research topic and outline, we will begin distributing our survey, which contains instructions about the questions that the students must respond to, via emails, sending it to each class officer, and privately messaging. The questionnaire will be given to participants with enough time to complete it. Once done, the researchers will then gather the survey questionnaires in order to arrange and analyze the data. The researchers will finally summarize the findings to develop a conclusion and suggestions for the entire study.</p>
                            <p>After the survey is completed, we believe that the mixed method research will widen the subject and provide insight into the effects of learning financial literacy on APEC students. We expect that this will help us gain a deeper comprehension, address the necessary problems, and provide a workable and effective solution.</p>
  <p>Aside from the survey, our group has also researched numerous aspects of financial literacy to add to the depth of our study. Through scholarly sources and trusted references, our knowledge on this topic widened and we are able to correlate statements together better.</p>
<p>All information we have gathered is documented on this website and can be seen all throughout which will be used in both our research and streaming journey.</p>
